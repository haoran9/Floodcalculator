# Floodcalculator

A flood risk evaluation with building attributes. This a Data science insight project in May 2020. 

Why elevation is so important with flooding risk? Only elevated buildings stand after hurricane and flooding from Mexico beach in 2018.

This a consulting project with [Forreunner](https://www.withforerunner.com/) to predict [first floor height(FFH)](https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1537-20490-8154/fema499_1_4.pdf)  for the flood risk height. 

This repo contains two topics, which is first to predict FFH via regression method(in ./regression_FFH.py) and then extract FFH information from Google stree view images via classification methods(in ./image_classification). 

Regression model result shows in the jupyter notebook but can not be shared here due to NDA with Forreunner.You can reach me at cugharrison@gmail.com for more detials about regression model and imgae classification model. 

More details are explained in the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sNwcPHI9Puw8WYK9wWDfNOixRx7JQtxzC4gQh5Uu3qY/edit#slide=id.p)

The data is not shared here due to NDA with Forreunner.
